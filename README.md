# School_District_Analysis

## Overview:

### Within PyCity School District there are fifteen high schools. An initial analsyis was conducted of each schools performance in reading and math. This included the number and percentage of passing grades as well as funds allocated for each district. Upon review of the initial analysis, the school board identified evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. 

### After replacing Thomas High School reading and math scores with NaNs, a school district analysis was repeated to see how these changes affected the overall analysis.
